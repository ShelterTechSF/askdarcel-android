# Ask Darcel App
##### *Built with React Native for Android and iPhone*

___
### Version
0.0.1

### Tech
* [React Native] [react-native]
* [Redux] [redux]

The Ask Darcel App is open source with a [public repository][repo]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

The current version of React Native for iOS requires [XCode][xcode] v7+ to run.
For android development [Android Studio][studio] provides emulator options. I recommend testing on a lower-end model with Jelly Bean.  

You need the React Native client installed globally:

```sh
$ npm install -g react-native-cli
```

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ShelterTechSF/askdarcel-app.git
$ cd askdarcel-app
$ npm install
```
